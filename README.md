What to wear? 

It's a daily question that we ask ourselves every day,
and how we can choose our clothes without making a mess in the closet?


My App - Smart Closet, provides a solution to these questions.


This App is about making outfits, saving your favorite sets
and most importantly lets you know the weather before you decide what to wear.

Use the API to get the weather.
